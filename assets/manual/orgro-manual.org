Welcome to Orgro

Orgro is an [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] file viewer.

Files open in "overview" visibility mode, with top sections folded.

Tap a section header to expand it ↓

* Supported Org Mode features

Orgro can understand the following Org Mode features:

** Sections

Sections can be opened and closed by touching the section headline.

TODO keywords, priority markers, and tags are highlighted and laid out nicely.

** Blocks

Blocks are laid out with horizontal scroll to keep code readable. They can also
be opened and closed just like sections by touching the block header.

   #+begin_src elisp
     (+ 1 2)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 3

The example above also illustrates affiliated keywords (the =#+RESULTS:= line)
and fixed-width areas (the =: 3= line). Fixed width areas also have horizontal
scroll to ensure proper display.

Diminish meta lines like =#+RESULTS:= with [[*Reader Mode][Reader Mode]].

** Syntax highlighting

Syntax highlighting is applied for [[https://github.com/git-touch/highlight/tree/master/highlight/lib/languages][many languages]] in =src= blocks.

#+begin_src bash
  #!/bin/bash

  ###### CONFIG
  ACCEPTED_HOSTS="/root/.hag_accepted.conf"
  BE_VERBOSE=false

  if [ "$UID" -ne 0 ]
  then
   echo "Superuser rights required"
   exit 2
  fi

  genApacheConf(){
   echo -e "# Host ${HOME_DIR}$1/$2 :"
  }

  echo '"quoted"' | tr -d \" > text.txt
#+end_src

#+begin_src ruby
  # The Greeter class
  class Greeter
    def initialize(name)
      @name = name.capitalize
    end

    def salute
      puts "Hello #{@name}!"
    end
  end

  g = Greeter.new("world")
  g.salute
#+end_src

#+begin_src python
  @requires_authorization
  def somefunc(param1='', param2=0):
      r'''A docstring'''
      if param1 > param2: # interesting
          print 'Gre\'ater'
      return (param2 - param1 + 1 + 0b10l) or None

  class SomeClass:
      pass

  >>> message = '''interpreter
  ... prompt'''
#+end_src

When the language is unknown or unspecified, ~code style~ is used:

#+begin_src
foo bar baz
#+end_src

** Tables

Tables are rendered as GUI tables (rather than as raw text) to ensure proper
spacing.

| Foo         |    Bar |  Baz |
|-------------+--------+------|
| Lorem ipsum | 30.000 |    1 |
| 123         |        |      |
| あいうえお  |  -1e24 | >3.5 |

** LaTeX fragments

Math in LaTeX markup is supported as both inline ($$ a^2 + b^2 $$) and block:

\begin{equation*}
\oint_{\partial \Sigma} \mathbf{B} \cdot \mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{l} = \mu_0 \left(\iint_{\Sigma} \mathbf{J} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{S} + \varepsilon_0 \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \iint_{\Sigma} \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{S} \right)
\end{equation*}

** Prettified entities

Special characters written with syntax like ~\﻿Omega~ or ~\﻿leftrightarrow~ are
shown with their "pretty" replacement characters: \Omega \leftrightarrow

Subscripts and superscripts are also prettified, and can contain entities:
H_{2}O, A^*, e_(\alpha + 1)

** Lists

When [[*Reader Mode][Reader Mode]] is enabled, list content is shown with content reflowed for
easy reading on narrow screens.

- foo
  - [X] bar
  - [ ] baz
    1. buzz
    2. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vestibulum ipsum
       sapien, molestie nec posuere at, porta sit amet neque. Duis vulputate
       quis est et vestibulum. Quisque vehicula dolor vestibulum vestibulum
       porta.
  - bazinga
    - thing :: this
    - thang :: that

** Drawers
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: foobar
   :END:

Drawers are collapsed by default, but can be opened by touching the header.

** Links

External links open in your web browser:

- Org-style bracketed links [[https://github.com/sponsors/amake][like this]]
- Raw URLs like https://github.com/sponsors/amake

Links to other sections in the same document open in a narrowed view. See
[[*Narrowing][Narrowing]].

Relative links to other Org Mode files are supported when Orgro has the required
access permissions:

file:./orgro-manual-linked.org

The above link doesn't require special permission because it points to a file
bundled with Orgro. But your files /will/ require permission; look for a banner
at the top of a document prompting you to grant access.

For more details, including supported apps and OS restrictions, see the [[https://orgro.org/faq/#how-can-i-use-relative-links-between-org-mode-files][FAQ]].

Image links are also supported; see [[*Images][Images]].

#+LINK: OrgroIssue https://github.com/amake/orgro/issues/

Link abbreviations are supported if they are defined via ~#+LINK:~ lines:
[[OrgroIssue:105]]

** Emphasis

The default emphasis markers are supported:

- *bold*
- /italic/
- _underline_
- +strikethrough+
- ~code~
- =verbatim=

Hide the emphasis markers with [[*Reader Mode][Reader Mode]].

** Images

Images referenced by relative paths can be displayed when Orgro has the required
access permissions:

[[./orgro-icon.png]]

The above image doesn't require special permission because it is bundled with
Orgro. But your images /will/ require permission; look for a banner at the top
of a document prompting you to grant access.

For more details, including supported apps and OS restrictions, see the [[https://orgro.org/faq/#how-can-i-use-relative-links-between-org-mode-files][FAQ]].

Further, HTTP(S) links to images can be optionally loaded and displayed inline:

[[https://orgro.org/assets/appicon.png]]

Long touch an image to open it in a view where you can zoom and pan.

Images are cached on your device. To clear the cache and reset your choice if
you chose =Always= or =Never=, see the action menu on the top screen.

** Footnotes

Jump to named foonotes by touching a footnote reference.[fn:1]

** Citations

#+bibliography: orgro.bib

Orgro can follow citations when a BibTeX bibliography has been specified like
above[cite:@OrgroManual]. Touch a citation for details.

** Attachments                                                       :ATTACH:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       C259CE94-D4C8-4C4F-9C9E-9ABE446E7DA3
   :END:

Orgro can show attached images and open links to attached Org Mode files like
so:

[[attachment:orgro-icon.png]]

[[attachment:orgro-manual-attachment.org]]

Note that this depends on the ability to resolve relative links. See the [[*Links][Links]]
section for details.

** Encryption

Orgro recognizes encrypted content (OpenPGP/RFC 4880 messages starting with
=-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----=) and will offer to decrypt it. Only symmetrically
(passphrase-only) encrypted messages can be decrypted.

If edited, decrypted content will be reencrypted with the same password on save.
To make this possible, Orgro retains the password in memory until the document
is closed. The password is not permanently stored anywhere.

[[file:orgro-manual-encrypted.org][Example]]

** Other

Other syntaxes that are highlighted but not (yet) interpreted in any special
way:

- Timestamps and ranges :: [2020-05-05 Tue]
- Anonymous footnotes :: guess what[fn:: this is an anonymous footnote]
- Macro references :: {{{date}}}

* Editing

Some limited “structured” editing features are available:

- Tap a list item with a checkbox to toggle the checkbox
  - [ ] Try me!
- Slide a section from right to left to cycle its TODO keyword

In addition, plain text editing is available from the floating edit button in
the bottom right corner.

If Orgro has the appropriate permissions, it will save changes back to the
original file. This is an experimental feature; see the [[https://orgro.org/faq/#can-i-edit-my-files-with-orgro][FAQ]] for details.

If Orgro does /not/ have the permissions it needs, it will prompt you to share
the content of your file when you close it.

Edits can be undone and redone from the action menu.

* Narrowing
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       2F5F32A8-5DB9-4FE7-BAAE-8BD328A73228
  :CUSTOM_ID: narrowing-section
  :END:

Orgro can "narrow" the view to a specific section in two ways:

- Open a link to a section
  - file:::#narrowing-section
  - file:::*Narrowing
  - id:2F5F32A8-5DB9-4FE7-BAAE-8BD328A73228
  - Even in other files:
    - file:orgro-manual-linked.org::#a-section
    - file:orgro-manual-linked.org::*Section
- Long touch a section headline

Close the narrowed view by touching the Back button in the top app bar.

* Reader Mode

Enable Reader Mode to reflow text, hide emphasis markers, and make meta lines
(lines starting with =#+=) less prominent. The Reader Mode toggle can be found
in one of two places:

- Narrow screens (phones) :: =Reader mode= in the action menu
- Wide screens (tablets) :: icon button in the top app bar

* Visibility Cycling

Rotate sections between expanded and collapsed states just like Org Mode in
Emacs:

1. Overview: Show only top-level headlines
2. Contents: Show all headlines of all levels, but no body text
3. Show all: Show everything

Activate with the button in the top app bar.

* Search

Touch the floating search button in the lower right of the screen. A search
field will appear in the top app bar; enter your query here. Relevant sections
will be expanded, while sections without hits will be collapsed. Hits are
highlighted. Navigate hits with the up and down buttons in the lower right of
the screen.

* Sparse trees

Touch the floating search button in the lower right of the screen. An input bar
will appear at the bottom of the screen above the keyboard with filter buttons:

- Custom :: Write an arbitrary sparse tree filter in a subset of the query
  language described in the [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Matching-tags-and-properties.html][Matching tags and properties]] section of the Org
  manual. See the [[https://orgro.org/faq][FAQ]] for details on limitations.

  Orgro will remember the last 10 custom filters. Long press the “Custom” button
  to directly apply a past filter.
- Keywords :: Filter by =TODO=, =DONE=, etc.
- Priorities :: Filter by section priority, e.g. =A=, =B=, =C=
- Tags :: Filter by section tags

* Text Style

Adjust the text size and font.

- Narrow screens (phones) :: in the action menu
- Wide screens (tablets) :: icon button in the top app bar

* Full screen width

On large screens, optionally let the document take up the entire screen width.

* Questions and Feedback

Feel free to raise an issue [[https://github.com/amake/orgro/issues][on GitHub]].

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Tap the reference here to jump back.

* STARTUP keywords

Org Mode supports a variety of options for controlling the initial appearance of
a document. These are specified with the ~#+STARTUP:~ keyword like so:

#+STARTUP: overview nohideblocks showstars

Options recognized by Orgro:

- [no]hideblocks
- [no]hidedrawers
- hidestars / showstars
- entitiespretty / entitiesplain
- [no]inlineimages
- [no]fold / overview / content / show[2..5]levels / showall / showeverything

* =TODO= keywords

Org Mode allows customizing headline keywords (default: =TODO=, =DONE=). Orgro
will interpret the ~#+TODO:~, ~#+SEQ_TODO:~, and ~#+TYP_TODO:~ keywords to inform:

- What are valid keywords (invalid keywords are merely part of a section title)
- What is the next state when [[*Editing][cycling the keyword]]

* Right-to-left scripts and bidi texts

Orgro supports right-to-left text layout:

من النهر إلى البحر / فلسطين ستتحرر

By default the direction for a paragraph is determined the same way as [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Bidirectional-Editing.html][in Emacs]]:
from the first strong directional character. To override this, you can set
~bidi-paragraph-direction~ to =right-to-left= or =left-to-right= in a [[*Local Variables][local
variables list]].

* Local Variables

Emacs allows defining a [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Specifying-File-Variables.html][local variables list]] like below. Orgro can interpret the
following settings from the local variables list:

- ~org-entities-user~ :: Specify additional [[*Prettified entities][entities]] for prettification. Syntax
  is the same as the “real” ~org-entities-user~, but only name and utf-8
  replacement are used:

  1. Name
  2. LaTeX replacement
  3. LaTeX mathp
  4. HTML replacement
  5. ASCII replacement
  6. Latin1 replacement
  7. utf-8 replacement

  With the setting in this file, you can use e.g. ~\﻿avocado~ to display \avocado.

- ~org-entities-local~ :: Same as ~org-entities-user~ but for use when you don’t
  want to overwrite your global ~org-entities-user~ value or include the entire
  value in your local variables. This is applied after the defaults and
  ~org-entities-user~.

- ~org-pretty-entities~ :: Whether to prettify entities. Pretty entities are
  enabled by default; you can use this to disable them.

- ~org-hide-emphasis-markers~ :: Whether to hide emphasis markers. Emphasis
  markers are hidden in [[*Reader Mode][Reader Mode]], but this allows hiding them outside of
  Reader Mode as well.

- ~bidi-paragraph-direction~ :: Override per-paragraph detection of text
  direction; see [[*Right-to-left scripts and bidi texts][Right-to-left scripts and bidi texts]].

To avoid having the local variables list show up in your exported docs, put it
under a section with the =COMMENT= keyword or =noexport= tag.

# Local Variables:
# org-entities-user: (
#   ("avocado" "[avocado]" nil "&#129361;" "[avocado]" "[avocado]" "🥑")
#   ("snowman" "[snowman]" nil "&#9731;" "[snowman]" "[snowman]" "☃")
# )
# End:
